<h1>java commandLine based calculator</h1>
there is dst and src folder of project<br>
the calculator class can be improved easily and we can make it better than<br>
now,andalso there is .jar file for execute and use it.<br>
and if you want have it in your own project just add class <strong>calculator</strong><br>
to your project and make instance of that and give it a string and call solver method <br>
there will be some feature update needing for this class and i write its code in a way<br>
that your(and my) hands can be open for next updating and adding features to it.
